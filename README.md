Joint Modelling of Logitudinal Measurements and Competing Risk Data
Project as a part of Masters degree in Biostatistics

In many clinical studies, there are scenarios where repeated measurements of a biomarker and survival time  are both recorded during follow up.
However,when the longitudinal and survival endpoints are associated,it may not be suitable to analyse such data using the well-established models and this requires the need for joint modelling approach.Most of the research so far has been focused only on one type of failure and does not involve distinguishing among the different types of failure.However,
in dealing with situations where the censoring is informative or when there is more than one type of failure, certain extensions of the existing models need to be considered.Such data are termed as competing risk data.

Objectives

1.To review the existing methodologies for  simultaneous analysis of longitudinal measurements and competing risks failure times to allow for more than one distinct failure type

2.To compare and contrast methods by applying on real world data using R software

3.To explore  dynamic prediction in joint models and its applicability in personalized medicine
